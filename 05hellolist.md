<p>In this assignment we will look into using lists and using them as data for the
templates.</p><p>The assignment has the server side functionality that handles a request to the
root path and adds a list for the template to process. The template that is
used to create the site is missing some functionality however.</p><p>Your task is to (1) print the values in the list between <code class="language-text">&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code class="language-text">&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tags, and (2) add a form that can
be used to send content to the server.</p><p>Once finished, submit the assignment to the TMC server.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
