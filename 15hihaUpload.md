<p>The assignment template contains the functionality for uploading and storing
personal files on a web server. The files uploaded by an individual should not
be accessible by anyone else. However, there seems to be a few flaws in how
this has been implemented. Fix the application so that everyone can access only
the files that they have uploaded (unauthorized actions should redirect to <code class="language-text">/</code>).</p><p>The application has the following username and password combinations for testing:</p><ul>
<li>alice:redqueen</li>
<li>bob:squarepants</li>
</ul>
